# Covid19 Stats App #

Our goal is to have a simple web app which offers information about Covid19 statistics per country.

API: https://covid19api.com/

Initial screen should consist of a single button, when clicked, an excerpt of the most recent data for at least 10 countries must be populated as a list.
The user should be able to click on a specific country and get detailed information about that country's current stats on the right side of the page. 
Bellow the detailed view, there should be a button, which offers a modal view and historical data for that country.

User should be able to sort already populated list by the number of infected people. 

The detail and modal views must be accessible by their own unique urls.

UX, styling and attention to detail is up to you.

**Bonus**: 
In DEV Mode Only - Making sure the browser will not do OPTIONS requests in the Network tab when getting remote data via fetch, configured to make POST requests.
